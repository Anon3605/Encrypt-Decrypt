Ceaser Cipher:
The Caesar Cipher, used by Julius Caesar around 58 BC, is a substitution cipher that 
shifts letters in a message to make it unreadable if intercepted. 
To decrypt, the receiver reverses the shift. Arab mathematician Al-Kindi broke the
Caesar Cipher using frequency analysis, which exploits patterns in letter frequencies.
Note: This process of Al-Kindi is called bruteforce in cyber security. 

Basically Ceaser Cipher doesn't contains speacial characters or what so ever.
It only uses alphabets and other series.

There are many types of ceaser cipher codes that are which are labelled as ROTATE or simply ROT.
As we see, ceaser cipher is kind of shifting the alphabets or characters, that's why rotate means the same;
As we can see, ROT1,ROT2, ROT3, ROT4, ROT5 .....ROT26 means only shifting alphabets to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... 26 indexes.
But 256 Characters or ASCII values are more fancy than 26 alphabets shifting, isn't that so?
